The testing algorithm is inside the DotnetSelenium folder and the file name is UnitTest1.cs

I selected the Nested Shadow DOM with 3 Levels for choosing the three fields. The chosen fields were First Name, Last Name and Description. I went through the shadow roots to get to the fields and made sure the algorithm works even if the position or any other properties of the HTML elements for those three fields were changed.
